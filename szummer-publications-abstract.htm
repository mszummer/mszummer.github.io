Finding good representations of text documents is crucial in information
retrieval and classification systems. Today the most popular document
representation is based on a vector of word counts in the document. This
representation neither captures dependencies between related words, nor
handles synonyms or polysemous words.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm to learn text document representations
based on semi-supervised autoencoders that are stacked to form a deep
network.  The model can be trained efficiently on partially labeled corpora,
producing very compact representations of documents, while retaining as
much class information and joint word statistics as possible.  We show that
it is advantageous to exploit even a few labeled samples during training.

We propose a semi-supervised learning to rank algorithm. It learns from both labeled data (pairwise preferences or absolute labels) and unlabeled data. The data can consist of multiple groups of items (such as queries), some of which may contain only unlabeled items. We introduce a preference regularizer favoring that similar items are similar in preference to each other. The regularizer captures manifold structure in the data, and we also propose a rank-sensitive version designed for top-heavy retrieval metrics including NDCG and mean average precision. 

 The regularizer is employed in SSLambdaRank, a semi-supervised version of LambdaRank. This algorithm directly optimizes popular retrieval metrics and improves retrieval accuracy over LambdaRank, a state-of-the-art ranker that was used as part of the winner of the Yahoo! Learning to Rank challenge 2010. The algorithm runs in linear time in the number of queries, and can work with huge datasets.

    Conf. Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)</i> <br>
We incorporate relevance feedback into a learning to rank framework by exploiting query-specific document similarities. Given a few judged feedback documents and many retrieved but unjudged documents for a query, we learn a function that adjusts the initial ranking score of each document. Scores are fit so that documents with similar term content get similar scores, and scores of judged documents are close to their labels. By such smoothing along the manifold of retrieved documents, we avoid overfitting, and can therefore learn a detailed query-specific scoring function with several dozen term weights.

Search engines can automatically reformulate user queries in a variety of ways, often leading to multiple queries that are candidates to replace the original. However, selecting a replacement can be risky: a reformulation may be more effective than the original or significantly worse, depending on the nature of the query, the source of reformulation candidates, and the corpus.  In this paper, we explore methods to mitigate this risk by issuing several versions of the query (including the original) and merging their results. We focus on reformulations generated by random walks on the click graph, a method that can produce very good reformulations but is also variable and prone to topic drift.  Our primary contribution is LambdaMerge, a supervised merging method that is trained to directly optimize a retrieval metric (such as NDCG or MAP) using features that describe both the reformulations and the documents they return.  In experiments on Bing data and GOV2, LambdaMerge outperforms the original query and several unsupervised merging methods. LambdaMerge also outperforms a supervised method to predict and select the best single formulation, and is competitive with an oracle that <i>always</i> selects the best formulation.

  <br>
We introduce a new descriptor for images which allows the construction of efficient and compact classifiers with good accuracy on object category recognition.  The descriptor is the output of a large
number of weakly trained object category classifiers on the image.  The
trained categories are selected from an ontology of visual concepts,
but the intention is not to encode an explicit decomposition of the scene.
Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode
not the category <i>per se</i> but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categories' semantic meanings.
<br>
The advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries
to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient
at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these
queries to be for novel categories.  Even when the representation is
reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category
recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36% versus 42%), but
at orders of magnitude lower computational cost.

To evaluate the diversity of search results, test collections have been
developed that identify multiple <i>intents</i> for each query. Intents are
the different meanings or facets that should be covered in a search results
list. This means that topic development involves proposing a set of
intents. We propose four measurable properties of query-to-intent mappings,
allowing for more principled topic development for such test collections.

We describe an algorithm for similar-image search which is designed to be
efficient for extremely large collections of images.  For each query, a
small response set is selected by a fast prefilter, after which
a more accurate ranker may be applied to each image in the response set.
We consider a class of prefilters comprising disjunctions of conjunctions
("ORs of ANDs") of Boolean features. AND filters can be implemented
efficiently using skipped inverted files, a key component of
web-scale text search engines.  These structures permit search in time
proportional to the response set size.  The prefilters are learned from
training examples, and refined at query time to produce an approximately
bounded response set.
<br>
We cast prefiltering as an optimization problem: for each test query,
select the OR-of-AND filter which maximizes training-set recall for an
adjustable bound on response set size.  This may be efficiently implemented
by selecting from a large pool of candidate conjunctions of Boolean
features using a linear program relaxation.  Tests on object class
recognition show that this relatively simple filter
is nevertheless powerful enough to capture some
semantic information.

  Decision Theoretic Framework for Ranking using Implicit Feedback</B></A> July 
  2008 <I>SIGIR 2008 Workshop on Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval</I> 
  <BR>This paper presents a decision theoretic ranking system that incorporates 
  both explicit and implicit feedback. The system has a model that predicts, 
  given all available data at query time, different interactions a person might 
  have with search results. Possible interactions include relevance labelling 
  and clicking. We define a utility function that takes as input the outputs of 
  the interaction model to provide a real valued score to the user's session. 
  The optimal ranking is the list of documents that, in expectation under the 
  model, maximizes the utility for a user session. The system presented is based 
  on a simple example utility function that combines both click behavior and 
  labelling. The click prediction model is a Bayesian generalized linear model. 
  Its notable characteristic is that it incorporates both weights for 
  explanatory features and weights for each query-document pair. This allows the 
  model to generalize to unseen queries but makes it at the same time flexible 
  enough to keep in a `memory' where the model should deviate from its feature 
  based prediction. Such a click-predicting model could be particularly useful 
  in an application such as enterprise search, allowing on-site adaptation to 
  local documents and user behaviour. The example utility function has a 
  parameter that controls the tradeoff between optimizing for clicks and 
  optimizing for labels. Experimental results in the context of enterprise 
  search show that a balance in the tradeoff leads to the best NDCG and good 
  (predicted) clickthrough.<BR><BR>

  apply a Markov random walk model to a large click log, producing a 
  probabilistic ranking of documents for a given query. A key advantage of the 
  model is its ability to retrieve relevant documents that have not yet been 
  clicked for that query and rank those effectively. We conduct experiments on 
  click logs from image search, comparing our ('backward') random walk model to 
  a different ('forward') random walk, varying parameters such as walk length

  random fields, specifically MRFs or CRFs. The introduction of graph cuts has 
  enabled efficient and optimal inference in associative random fields, greatly 
  advancing applications such as segmentation, stereo reconstruction and many 
  others. However, while fast inference is now widespread, parameter learning in 
  random fields has remained an intractable problem. This paper shows how to 
  apply fast inference algorithms, in particular graph cuts, to learn parameters 
  of random fields with similar efficiency. We find optimal parameter values 
  under standard regularized objective functions that ensure good 
  generalization. Our algorithm enables learning of many parameters in

  efficient optimization of challenging, so-called non-submodular, binary 
  pairwise MRFs. A promising graph cut based approach for optimizing such MRFs 
  known as "roof duality" was recently introduced into computer vision. We study 
  two methods which extend this approach. First, we discuss an efficient 
  implementation of the "probing" technique introduced recently by Boros et al. 
  2006. It simplifies the MRF while preserving the global optimum. Our code is 
  400-700 faster on some graphs than the implementation of [Boros 2006]. Second, 
  we present a new technique which takes an arbitrary input labeling and tries 
  to improve its energy. We give theoretical characterizations of local minima 
  of this procedure. We applied both techniques to many applications, including 
  image segmentation, new view synthesis, super-resolution, diagram recognition, 
  parameter learning, texture restoration, and image deconvolution. For several 
  applications we see that we are able to find the global minimum very 
  efficiently, and considerably outperform the original roof duality approach. 
  In comparison to existing techniques, such as graph cut, TRW, BP, ICM, and

  Meek 600-607 <BR>Representations based on random walks can exploit discrete 
  data distributions for clustering and classification. We extend such 
  representations from discrete to continuous distributions. Transition 
  probabilities are now calculated using a diffusion equation with a diffusion 
  coefficient that varies inversely with the data density. We relate this 
  diffusion equation to a path integral and derive the corresponding path 
  probability measure. The framework is useful for incorporating continuous data 
  densities and prior knowledge.<BR><BR>

  <I>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)</I> 945-952 14 
  <BR>To classify a large number of unlabeled examples we combine a limited 
  number of labeled examples with a Markov random walk representation over the 
  unlabeled examples. The random walk representation exploits any low 
  dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We 
  develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this 
  representation. This includes in particular multi-way classification with an 
  average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale 
  of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a 
  margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classification. We also extend 
  this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We 
  demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classification 
  problems.<BR><BR>

  Information Processing Systems (NIPS)</I> 626-632 13 <BR>Modern 
  classification applications necessitate supplementing the few available 
  labeled examples with unlabeled examples to improve classification 
  performance. We present a new tractable algorithm for exploiting unlabeled 
  examples in discriminative classification. This is achieved essentially by 
  expanding the input vectors into longer feature vectors via both labeled and 
  unlabeled examples. The resulting classification method can be interpreted as 
  a discriminative kernel density estimate and is readily trained via the EM 
  algorithm, which in this case is both discriminative and achieves the optimal 
  solution. We provide, in addition, a purely discriminative formulation of the 
  estimation problem by appealing to the maximum entropy framework. We 
  demonstrate that the proposed approach requires very few labeled examples for 
  high classification accuracy.<BR><BR></LI></UL>

  Aided Diagnosis of Bone Lesions in the Facial Skeleton</B></A> March 1998 
  Aachen, Germany <I>Workshop Bildverarbeitung für die Medizin</I> <BR>We 
  present a system for computer aided diagnosis of bone tumors in the facial 
  skeleton. There are many different lesions with ra&shy;diographic 
  manifestation in the jaws. Our system helps performing the differential 
  diagnosis of these. The input is a digitized orthopantomograph (OPG) in which 
  the user marks the position of the lesion with a single mouse click. An active 
  contour model then automatically finds the boundaries of the lesion. 
  Gray&shy;level histograms, MRSAR texture featu&shy;res and Gabor filter 
  features are computed for the lesion region. These features are then combined 
  and used to query a database containing expert-diagnosed reference cases. The 
  result is a number of similar cases, with tumor position marked and with 
  available expert annotations. We show good agreement between our results and 
  differential diagnosis given by humans. The system is also a suitable tool for 
  training and education.<BR><BR>

  Image Classification</B></A> January 1998 Bombay, India <I>IEEE International

  42-51 <BR>We show how high-level scene properties can be inferred from 
  classification of low-level image features, specifically for the 
  indoor-outdoor scene retrieval problem. We systematically studied the 
  features: (1) histograms in the Ohta color space (2) multiresolution, 
  simultaneous autoregressive model parameters (3) coefficients of a 
  shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing 
  features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these 
  results in a way reminiscent of ``stacking.'' State of the art single-feature 
  methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new 
  method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse 
  database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak.<BR><BR>

  addition to the problem of <i>which</i> image analysis models to use in digital 
  libraries, e.g. wavelet, Wold, color histograms, is the problem of <i>how</i> to 
  combine these models with their different strengths. Most present systems 
  place the burden of combination on the user, e.g. the user specifies 50% 
  texture features, 20% color features, etc. This is a problem since most users 
  do not know how to best pick the settings for the given data and search 
  problem. This paper addresses this problem, describing research in progress 
  for a system that (1) automatically infers which combination of models best 
  represents the data of interest to the user and (2) learns continuously during 
  interaction with each user. In particular, these two components -- inference 
  and learning -- provide a solution that adapts to the subjective and 
  hard-to-predict behaviors frequently seen when people query or browse image 
  libraries.<BR><BR>

  <I></I><BR>Large image databases with millions of images are being built. It 
  is very tedious to browse these databases; the user will only have time to see 
  a small fraction of the images. Currently, there are very few tools that 
  assist the user in finding the right selection of images. This project 
  combines learning algorithms and machine vision techniques to create a 
  flexible and powerful image browser. The user is presented with a selection of 
  images. They select positive and negative examples of the type of images they 
  want to see or avoid seeing. The browser analyzes the examples and chooses the 
  best search metrics. It then uses these metrics to find images similar to the 
  examples. The results form a hierarchy that the user can browse with a tree 
  browser. Next, the user selects more positive and negative examples, and the 
  process repeats.<BR><BR>

  Understanding with a Grammar of Constructions</B></A> August 1994 Kyoto, Japan 
  <I>Intl. Conf. on Computational Linguistics COLING</I> 1289-1293 15 <BR>We 
  present an approach to natural language understanding based on a computable 
  grammar of constructions. A "construction" consists of a set of features of 
  form and a description of meaning in a context. A grammar is a set of 
  constructions. This kind of grammar is the key element of Mincal, an 
  implemented natural language, speech-enabled interface to an on-line calendar 
  system. The system consists of a NL grammar, a parser, an on-line calendar, a 
  domain knowledge base (about dates, times and meetings), an application 
  knowledge base (about the calendar), a speech recognizer, a speech generator, 
  and the interfaces between those modules. We claim that this architecture 
  should work in general for spoken interfaces in small domains. In this paper 
  we present two novel aspects of the architecture: (a) the use of 
  constructions, integrating descriptions of form, meaning and context into one 
  whole; and (b) the separation of domain knowledge from application knowledge. 
  We describe the data structures for encoding constructions, the structure of 
  the knowledge bases, and the interactions of the key modules of the 
  system.<BR><BR></LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
